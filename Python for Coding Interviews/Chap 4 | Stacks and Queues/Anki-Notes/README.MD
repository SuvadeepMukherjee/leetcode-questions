# Stacks and Queues

| Question                                                     | Operation    | Time Complexity of Operation |

| In a Python stack implemented using a list, which method is used to **push** an element? | `append()`   | `O(1)`                       |
| In a Python stack, which method is used to **remove and return** the top element? | `pop()`      | `O(1)`                       |
| How can you **access the top element without removing it** from a stack implemented as a list? | `stack[-1]`  | `O(1)`                       |
| Which function is commonly used to **check if a stack is empty** in Python? | `len(stack)` | `O(1)`                       |
